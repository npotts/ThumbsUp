ThumbsUp
========

....because sometimes, an actual thumbs up is warranted.


A Sign of Endorsement
=====================

![Dont Do This](examples/dont-do-this.jpg "Dont Do This!!!")

Forget all those corporate "thumbs up" by the likes of facebook or google + hoping for your dollar$.  Give a honest thumbs up on things you approve of. Rather than click a stupid meaningless icon on a website, fork this repo and add your own thumb stamp of approval to things you approve of. Dont let those corporate types do it all for you.

Additionally, unlike facebook and google+, you can easily give a thumbs down to indicate displeasure.  This comes in handy for your least favorite team, or places you dont like.
