Forget all those corporate "thumbs up" ploys as in Facebook's ![I Hate this fake "like" business](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npotts/ThumbsUp/master/examples/fb-like.png "I hate this fake "like" business") or Google's ![Yes, I have that many +1's](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npotts/ThumbsUp/master/examples/g+n.png "Yes, I have that many +1's") who are seriously only lurching for your dollar$.  Give a honest thumbs up on things you approve of. Rather than click a stupid meaningless icon on a website, fork this repo and add your own thumb stamp of approval to things you approve of. Dont let those corporate types do it all for you.

Additionally, unlike Facebook and Google+, you can easily give a thumbs down to indicate displeasure.  This comes in handy for your least favorite team, or places you dont like.
