Give a honest thumbs up on things you approve of. Rather than click a stupid meaningless icon on a website, fork this repo and add your own thumb stamp of approval to things you approve of. Dont let those corporate types do it all for you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, unlike facebook and google+, you can easily give a thumbs down to indicate displeasure.  This comes in handy for your least favorite team, or places you dont like.\r\n\r\nEndorsements\r\n============\r\n\r\n![Chicken City](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npotts/ThumbsUp/master/examples/chicken-city.jpg \"Chicken City....
